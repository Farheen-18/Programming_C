Grades_Question

Write a C program that prepares a report card for a student. The function report()  takes value marks from the user (integer values ranging from 0 to 100). Based on the marks, the function should assign and print the corresponding grade according to the following grading key:

90 - 100: Grade A

80 - 89: Grade B

70 - 79: Grade C

60 - 69: Grade D

50 - 59: Grade E

0 - 49: Grade F

Your function should also be capable of handling invalid inputs, such as marks outside the range 0-100. The function should not print anything.

The function returns a character that is assigned to the student (their grade). In case of invalid input, return 'X'.
