Write a program that takes two distances as input. The distances are in the form of X kilometers and Y meters.

For example, 23 68 means 23 kilometers and 68 meters. Store the distances in a structure. After that, find the
difference between the two distances. Store this difference in another structure. (1000 meter = 1 kilometer). It is
guaranteed that the second distance is greater than the first distance.

A structure definition has been provided, complete the missing parts of the code!

Testcase1

    Input:                                             Input:

         Enter first distance = 5 40                    Enter first distance = 1 500
         Enter second distance = 10 60                  Enter second distance = 2 0

    Output:                                           Output:

        The difference is = 5 kilometers and 20 meters     The difference is = 0 kilometers and 500 meters
