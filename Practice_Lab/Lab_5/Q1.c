/* PracticeLab2_Question1

The program checks if the given number is:

1. Armstrong number:
Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example, 0, 1, 153, 370, and 371 are
the Armstrong numbers.371 = 3^3+7^3+1^3 (^ means the power of).

2. Perfect number:
In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding
the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.

Testcase 1
Input a number to check: 371
371 is an Armstrong number.
371 is NOT a Perfect number.

Testcase 2 
Input a number to check: 496
496 is NOT an Armstrong number.
496 is a Perfect number.

Testcase 3
Input a number to check: 40
40 is NOT an Armstrong number.
40 is NOT a Perfect number.
