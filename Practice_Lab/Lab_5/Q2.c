/* The program checks if the given number is a perfect number:

In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding
the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2, and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.

Testcase 1
Input a number to check: 371
371 is NOT a Perfect number.

Testcase 2 
Input a number to check: 496
496 is a Perfect number.

Testcase 3
Input a number to check: 40
40 is NOT a Perfect number. */
