[C] Evaluate the following expressions and show their hierarchy. 

(a) g = big / 2 + big * 4 / big - big + abc / 3 ; 
(abc = 2.5, big = 2, assume g to be a float) 

Soln.: g= 2/2 + 2*4/2 - 2 + 2.5/3
g = (2/2) + ( (2*4) / 2 ) - 2 + (2.5/3)
= 1 + (8/2) - 2 + (2.5/3)
= 1 + 4 - 2 + 0
= 5-2
= 3.00
------------------------------------------

(b) on = ink * act / 2 + 3 / 2 * act + 2 + tig ; 
(ink = 4, act = 1, tig = 3.2, assume on to be an int) 

Soln.: on = 4 * 1 / 2 + 3 / 2 * 1 + 2 + 3.2
= ((4 * 1) / 2) + ((3/2) * 1) + 2 + 3.2
= (4/2) + (1*1) + 2 + 3.2
= 2 + 1 + 2 + 3.2
= 8.20 = 8
------------------------------------------

(c) s = qui * add / 4 - 6 / 2 + 2 / 3 * 6 / god ; 
(qui = 4, add = 2, god = 2, assume s to be an int) 

Soln.: s = 4 * 2 / 4 - 6 / 2 + 2 /3 * 6 / 2
= ((4*2)/4) - (6/2) + (((2/3)*6)/2)
= (8/4) - 3 + ((0*6)/2)
= 2 - 3 + (0/2)
= -1 + 0
= -1
------------------------------------------

(d) s = 1 / 3 * a / 4 - 6 / 2 + 2 / 3 * 6 / g ; 
(a = 4, g = 3, assume s to be an int) 

s= 1/3 * 4 - 6 / 2 + 2/3 * 6/3
 = ((1/3) * 4) - (6/2) + ((2/3) * (6/3))
= (0 * 4) - 3 + (0 * 2)
= - 3
===========================================
[D]  Evaluate the result:
(a) g = 10 / 5 /2 / 1 ; 
Soln:
g= 10/5/2/1;
= 2/2/1
= 1/1
=1
-----------------------------------
(b) b = 3 / 2 + 5 * 4 / 3 ; 
= (3/2) + ( (5*4) / 3)
= 1 + (20/3)
= 1 + 6
= 7
------------------------------------
(c) a = b = c = 3 + 4 ;
a=b=c=7
c=7
b=7
a=7
====================================
[E] Convert the following equations into corresponding C 
statements.  [Just take care of brackets + priority]
===================================
 [F] What would be the output of the following programs: 
 
(a) main( ) 
   { 
      int   i = 2, j = 3, k, l ; 
      float   a, b ; 
      k = i / j * j ; //(2/3)*3 = 0
      l = j / i * i ; // (3/2)*2 = 2
      a = i / j * j ; // (2/3)*3 = 0.00
      b = j / i * i ; // (3/2) * 2 = 2.00
      printf( "%d %d %f %f", k, l, a, b ) ; 
} 

Output:
0 2 0.00 2.00
----------------------------------
(b) main( ) 
{ 
      int  a, b ; 
      a = -3 -- 3 ; 
      b = -3 -- ( - 3 ) ; 
      printf ( "a = %d b = %d", a, b ) ; 
}
----------------------------------
(c) 
main( ) 
{ 
   float a = 5,  b = 2 ; 
   int c ; 
   c = a % b ; 
   printf ( "%d", c ) ; 
} 
---------------------------------
